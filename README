A Python program to convert a text into PPT using beamer(LaTeX).

Ideally, people when they are preparing for a presentation they make 
a rough sketch of the entire PPT and then start putting it into main
draft.

So it struck me, Why don't we make a tool that directly gets you to the
actual draft from the sketch. 

This tool takes a text prefixed with appropriate sentinels and converts
it into beamer text. This is highly customizable. A config file is 
provided that can change the sentinels to your whim and fancies. 

And, accidentally, this can also be used as a clutter free environment
( without all the backslashes, and dollars of latex) to write a PPT 
in beamer.

Usage
-----
Please use 'beambuilder -h'


Example input Text
------------------
:Title1
--Level1-point1
;;Level2-p1
;;Level2-p2
;;Level2-p3
--Level1-point2
--Level1-point3

Config File
----------
The fields in the config file _must_ be present. It gives the author name 
and sentinels for the program.

author = Anish Kumar S
title = :
level1 = --
level2 = ;;
